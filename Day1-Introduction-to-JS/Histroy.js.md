# JavaScript History

## Origins (1995)
JavaScript was created by **Brendan Eich** in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Originally called "Mocha," then "LiveScript," it was renamed JavaScript as a marketing strategy when Netscape and Sun Microsystems formed a partnership.

## Early Years (1996-1999)
- Released with Netscape Navigator 2.0
- Became an ECMAScript standard (ECMA-262) in 1997
- Added core features: prototypes, first-class functions, closures
- Internet Explorer adopted it, leading to standardization efforts

## Browser Wars (2000-2005)
- AJAX emerged, enabling asynchronous web requests
- JavaScript gained importance in dynamic web experiences
- Major browser implementations (IE, Firefox, Chrome) competed on performance

## Modern Era (2006-Present)
- **2006**: jQuery library simplified DOM manipulation
- **2009**: Node.js brought JavaScript to server-side development
- **2015**: ES6 (ES2015) revolutionized the language with classes, arrow functions, promises, and modules
- **2016+**: Annual updates (ES2016, ES2017...) added async/await, destructuring, and more
- **Today**: JavaScript dominates web development and extends to mobile, desktop, and IoT applications

## Key Milestones
- Async/await support (2017)
- Widespread adoption of TypeScript
- Framework explosion: React, Vue, Angular
- Full-stack JavaScript development
